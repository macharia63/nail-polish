# nail-polish
My Project is about an online nail polish store where the users are able to purchase products and their products are delivered for free.

   ## Bugs/Problem Encountered
   - I was having problem deploying my project to heroku and installation of whitenoise.
   ##### Deploying my project
   - I used Gitpod workspace and added content with the following commands to push to GitHub;
   1. Git add "file name".
   2. Git commit -m "commit message"
   3. git push 
   - It was later pushed to Heroku through this steps;
   1. Create "requirements.txt" file
      pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
   2. Create "Procfile" file
      web: gunicorn..
   3. Login Heroku
   4.Setting Config Vars: Heroku homepage - Select "nail-polish" project - Setting - Click "Reveal Config Vars" - Create Config Vars and save
   - Then install whitenoise using 
      - pip3 install whitenoise
   - I made sure staticfiles are configured correctly
      - STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
   - I made sure I was using the static template tag to refer to your static files, rather that writing the URL directly
      - {% load static %}
   - I placed WhiteNoise middleware directly after the Django security middleware
      - 'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',
  - Added compression and caching support in setting.py
     - STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'whitenoise.storage.CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage'
  - Used a Content-Delivery Network
     - STATIC_HOST = os.environ.get('DJANGO_STATIC_HOST', '')
     - STATIC_URL = STATIC_HOST + '/static/'
  - disabled Djangoâ€™s static file handling and allow WhiteNoise to take over simply by passing the --nostatic option to the runserver command
     - 'whitenoise.runserver_nostatic',
   - Type commands as below for git add / commit / git push
    - git add
    - git commit -m "commit message" 
    - git push
  - Type commands as below for git remote
  1. git remote add heroku
  2. git push -u heroku main
  3. git remote -v
  4. Run the webpage
